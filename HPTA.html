    <h1 class="tropical"> Tropical Destinations</h1>
    <p class="tropical">Dreamy beaches, silky warm seas, lush scenery, and endless sunshine: These are some of 
        the top ingredients of the ideal tropical vacation. But each destination offers its own sultry charms. 
        Some dazzle with their natural beauty. Others add cultural attractions to the mix, with exotic customs, 
        architecture, and mouthwatering cuisine. A few offer eco-adventures and wildlife-rich wilderness, 
        and some sleepy islands seem to take you back in time. Divers flock to thriving coral reefs, and 
        surfers seek the perfect wave. It's just a matter of finding the perfect fit. From Asia to Australia 
        and the US to the Caribbean, this list of 15 tropical vacation hot spots covers some of the most beautiful 
        islands in the world as well as ideas of fun things to do and destinations for all budgets, whether you're 
        seeking an over-the-water bungalow in Bora Bora or a bamboo hut on a Bali beach.
